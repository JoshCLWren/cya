You're walking through the tall grass on your way to the next town when you hear a rustling behind you. You turn around and see a small, furry creature standing there. It looks up at you with big, innocent eyes and you can't help but chuckle. "Aww, it's just a little Pikachu," you say as you reach down to pet it. Suddenly, it jumps up and shocks you with a bolt of electricity! "Ow! What the heck, Pikachu!" you shout, but it just cowers behind a tree, looking apologetic. You sigh and rub your sore arm, wondering if you should catch this mischievous little Pokemon. 
Reese's response: I want to catch lucario

You throw a Poke Ball at the Pikachu, but it manages to dodge it. You try again and again, but it seems like this Pikachu is too quick for you. You'll have to think of something else if you want to catch it.

I approach the Pokemon and try to catch it in a Pokeball, but it keeps dodging. I try again and again, but it seems to be too quick for me. Suddenly, it starts to glow and it evolves into a Machamp!
