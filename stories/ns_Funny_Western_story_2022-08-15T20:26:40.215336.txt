You're in the middle of a dusty old Western town, surrounded by the remains of a shootout. There are dead bodies everywhere, and the stench of gunpowder hangs heavy in the air. You hear a noise coming from the nearby saloon and decide to investigate.

As you approach the saloon, you can hear the sound of someone inside playing the piano. You cautiously enter, half expecting a gunfight to break out, but instead you find a lone figure sitting at the piano, playing a mournful tune.
