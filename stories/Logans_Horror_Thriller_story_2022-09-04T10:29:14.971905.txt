You're frozen in fear, and you know that if you don't do something, the creature is going to kill you.

What do you do?

The AI response returned in 12.2179 seconds: 

A) You start running away from the creature, but it's quickly gaining on you. You hear it panting and snarling behind you, and you know that it's only a matter of time before it catches up to you. You see a light up ahead, and you know that you're getting close to the edge of the forest. You're about to reach safety when you feel the creature's teeth sink into your leg, and you scream in pain.

B) You turn to face the creature, and you can see the hunger in its eyes. You know that you're not going to be able to fight it off, but you're not going to go down without a fight. You take a swing at the creature, but it easily dodges your attack. It swipes at you with its claws, and you feel them slice through your skin. You stumble backwards, and the creature takes the opportunity to pounce on you. You feel its teeth sink into your flesh, and you scream in agony as it starts to eat you alive.

C) You fall to the ground and play dead, hoping that the creature will take the hint and leave you alone. For a moment, it looks like it's working, as the creature stops
