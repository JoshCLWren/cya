"I'm going to find my own prince," she said, storms brewing in her eyes. It was an ultimatum, and her friends knew it. They had set her up on so many blind dates, and she was done. She was done with being the only single one in the group. She was done with being set up with guys who were nothing like what she wanted. She was done with being set up, period.

So, she set out on a quest. She would find her own prince. And she did. She found him in the most unlikely of places, and he was everything she could have ever wanted in a man. He was kind, considerate, and he made her laugh. They were perfect for each other, and she knew it.
